- Trunk Height - The total height of the combined strunk segments

- Step Height - The height in pixels of each vertical trunk segment

![step_height](https://github.com/archaicvirus/TreeGenerator/assets/25288625/ea9f9d65-8430-401d-945f-2f3a48e6c348)

- Shift/Step - The random horizontal shift range in pixels, to shift each trunk segment as it 'grows' upwards

- Sprite Id - The sprite id use for the mesh fill algorithm - (used in the trunk and branch texture)
